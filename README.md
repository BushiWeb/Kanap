# Kanap #

This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

## Prerequisites ##

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.


## Back end Installation ##

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.


## Front end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "front" folder of the project, run `npm install`. This command
will install all the packages needed for the developement:

* Webpack for bundling and minifying
* Babel for transpiling
* Jest for unit testing
* Testing Library DOM, Jest-DOM and User-event for integration testing
* Nightwatch for E2E testing
